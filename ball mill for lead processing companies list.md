<h3>ball mill for lead processing companies list</h3><img src='1708332445.jpg' alt=''><p>A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind, blend, and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls. The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel, stainless steel, ceramic, or rubber.</p><p>Lead processing companies list includes several prestigious names involved in the lead industry.
