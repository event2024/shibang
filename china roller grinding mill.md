Compared with traditional mills, this equipment can save up to 30% of energy. It adopts a high-pressure spring system, which greatly reduces the power consumption of the mill. In addition, the grinding roller and grinding ring are made of special materials, which greatly extend their service life and reduce maintenance costs.</p><p>Moreover, the China Roller Grinding Mill has a stable performance, and its production capacity is also remarkable. The advanced milling structure design ensures the uniformity of the ground powder, and the particle size can be adjusted freely in the range of 80-800 mesh. This mill is suitable for a wide range of materials, such as limestone, dolomite, calcite, talc, kaolin, barite, fluorite, and more.</p><p>Environmental protection is always a key consideration in the modern industry. The China Roller Grinding Mill adheres to the principle of green production and has passed the environmental evaluation and certification. The dust collector is equipped with an advanced filtration system, which effectively purifies the exhaust gas and meets the national environmental protection standards.
